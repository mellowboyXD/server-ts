# Typescript Server

This is just a simple Javascript/Typescript backend that serves HTML to the client.

## Next Feature to implement

- Add htmx support
- Add tailwind

but first, I have to connect the app to a viable linux server. Probably going to use [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com). 

**P.S** changes coming soon
